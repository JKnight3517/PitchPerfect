# PitchPerfect

This is an app this displays the usefulness of the iOS AVFoundation. It utilizes a lot of built-in functionality and looks great.


Right now I'm not releasing this on the App Store as this is part of an educational project with Udacity but let me know if
you have any suggestions on making the app better.
